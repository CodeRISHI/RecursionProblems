#Recursion Problems

####by Arun Vasudevan

This is a one-page website with several JavaScript problems using recursion. The site enables the visitor to test each problem with inputs and see the results.

The site was built using:

1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. JQuery
5. Bootstrap

####Usage

Once you enter an input (or inputs) into the fields, press **Calculate** to ‘solve’ the problem. A dynamically generated answer will appear on the page. Press **Clear** to clear all fields and try again.

###The problems included are:

1. Factorial - _returns a single number_
2. GCD - _returns the greatest common denominator_
3. Range - _returns an array with numbers between the min & max (arguments)_
4. Array Sum - _returns the sum of all real integers in the array_
5. Exponent - _returns the exponent of base^(exp)_
6. Fibonacci Series - _returns a series of Fibonacci Numbers up to and including the input number (argument)_
7. Even or Not - _returns either ‘odd’ or ‘even’ depending on the input_
8. Binary Search - _uses a standard Binary Search algorithm to return the index at which the input (argument) is found_
9. Factorial Array - _returns an array of all factorials up to and including the input number (argument)_
10. Array Reverse - _returns an array of values in reverse order_
11. Array Average - _returns the average of all numbers in an array (works with nested arrays *only* in console)_
